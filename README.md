# REACT CLASSICAL vs. REACT-HOOKS SIDE-BY-SIDE STARTER

## Instructions:

This app is designed to display _TWO_ React apps side-by-side. These two apps share a CSS file, called `Shared_Styles.css`. 

You've been given two applications that are, from the user's perspective, identical as they render on the page. However, under the hood, they're a bit different!

You've been provided with the code for a Classical React application (whose code you'll find in the `ClassAppSrc` folder), and the scaffolding to implement identical functionality using React Hooks (whose code files you'll find in the `HooksAppSrc` folder). 

These apps render side-by-side in the browser. Your goal is to add code so that the left side (Classical React) identically matches the right side (React Hooks).

Given that you'll continue using the `Shared_Styles.css` file to style both applications, you'll need to make sure the one you write using React Hooks employs the right code such that the styling will match its Classical React counterpart. 

## Notes:

- Do not edit the code in `Dont_Edit_These_Styles.css`
