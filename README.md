# REACT CLASSICAL vs. REACT-HOOKS SIDE-BY-SIDE STARTER

## Instructions

This app is designed to display _TWO_ React apps side-by-side. 

You've been given two applications that are, from the user's perspective, identical when they render on the page. However, under the hood, they're a bit different! 

You've been provided with the code for a Classical React application, and the scaffolding to implement identical functionality using React Hooks. 

These apps render side-by-side in the browser. Your goal is to add code so that the left side (Classical React) identically matches the right side (React Hooks).
